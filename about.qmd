<p>
  **AI product engineer** with 4 years of expreience, It's my interest to create tools that enhance productivity and creativity.
  `Computer Vision`, such as object detection and image segmentation is what I've focused since,
  however `applying LLM to personalizing user experience.` is my recent interest too.
</p>

<p>
  Such a person who boldly asks 'why' and 'why not' was and will be me. The approach has been my guiding principle up to this day.
  I'm fascinated by how technology can `breathe new life into everyday experiences`.
  Throughout my journey, I've gained diverse perspectives and insights from various fields.
  Not the destination but the journey itself is my main concern. I will continue to `push my technical boundaries constantly`.
