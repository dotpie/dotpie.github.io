    "text": "AI product engineer with 4 years of expreience, It’s my interest to create tools that enhance productivity and creativity. Computer Vision, such as object detection and image segmentation is what I’ve focused since, however applying LLM to personalizing user experience. is my recent interest too.\n\n\nSuch a person who boldly asks ‘why’ and ‘why not’ was and will be me. The approach has been my guiding principle up to this day. I’m fascinated by how technology can breathe new life into everyday experiences. Throughout my journey, I’ve gained diverse perspectives and insights from various fields. Not the destination but the journey itself is my main concern. I will continue to push my technical boundaries constantly."
